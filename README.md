Guidelines -

Complex ADT, Vector ADT, Matrix ADT - some utility functions put together
Input - all data that can be used for testing
Input Program - program that can be used to generate input
Testing - header files and processor-timing programs that can be used to generate output
Results - CSV files and jupyter notebook containing the results of testing
Linear Algebra - Has methods like crout's, doolittle's algorithm, strassen's algorithm, Gauss Jordan method
